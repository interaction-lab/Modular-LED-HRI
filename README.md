Readme file for our LED Modular System

GUI interacts with an Arduino, which will control the RGBW LED Strip

#Installation
=============
#Arduino Library
===========
#1. LightSignal

To install the library, first quit the Arduino application. Then download the package and copy the .h and .cpp files from the LightSignal folder. Move these files into a folder called "LightSignal". Drag the LightSignal folder into this folder (your libraries folder). Under Windows, it will likely be called "My Documents\Arduino\libraries". For Mac users, it will likely be called "Documents/Arduino/libraries". On Linux, it will be the "libraries" folder in your sketchbook. 

Your Arduino library folder should now look like this (on Windows):

  My Documents\Arduino\libraries\LightSignal\LightSignal.cpp
  
  My Documents\Arduino\libraries\LightSignal\LightSignal.h
  ....


or like this (on Mac and Linux):

  Documents/Arduino/libraries/LightSignal/LigthSignal.cpp
  
  Documents/Arduino/libraries/LightSiganl/LightSignal.h
