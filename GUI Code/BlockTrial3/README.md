README file for Modular LED Project GUI 

This is a Qt Project. To Open this in Qt, select "Open Project" and open BlockTrial.pro.
Each LED is represented by an LEDLabel object (a modified QLabel object). 

First, main.cpp will create a MainWindow object. This MainWindow object creates an LEDLabel 
object whenever the user adds an LED. When a user wants to assign a behavior to LEDs, The 
MainWindow object creates a BehaviorWindow object. When a user wants to display the stored 
patterns, the MainWindow object opens a DisplayWindow object.



Using the Qt Application:

In the main window, there are three modes. 
	The first mode is "Move and Add", denoted by an icon with a hand and arrows. In this
mode, the user can add LEDs using the buttons on the right or the number input. The
user can also drag the LEDs around in this mode.
	The second mode is "Select". In this mode, the user selects a group of LEDs for 
further action. If the user selects the background instead, the selection of 
LEDs clears.	
	The third mode is "Assign IDs". In this mode, the user clicks on a selected LED and
every LED gets assigned a value. The user should select an LED at the end of a 
string of selected LEDs for best results.

When the user wants to add a behavior to a selected group of LEDs, he/she presses on "Add 
Behavior". The user selects all necessary settings, and then selects "Set Attributes". The
LEDs on the MainWindow object should change color correspondingly, and will remain selected.

When the user wants to display the stored patterns, he/she selects "Open Display Window", 
and will receive a list of groups he/she has assigned.
